# MySQL
* On a virtual machine running Linux, deploy MySQL and create a database with a table (script.sql)
* Create a new user in the database with select rights only. Try to execute another command under it. The response should be 'command' denied to 'user'
* Back up the database, drop one table/column/part of the database (of your choice), restore the database from the backup
